    "In this project, we create an agent that plays blackjack with another pre-written agent in a deterministic environment. the algorithm used for finding agent's best decisions is MiniMax. first we play with basic minimax algorithm and then we use a method called Alpha-Beta Pruning to speed up search and prune search tree.\n",

    "### __there are some changes in project's initial template:__\n",
    "- __a method named minimax was added to Blacksin class for building minimax search tree.__\n",
    "starting from current state as a Max node we try to maximize players expected reward. we check all possible values and expand current node with depth-first search by simulating all moves on copies of game environment, then we pass game to next level of tree where is a Min level. in Min nodes we simulate opponents moves by trying to minimize game's result as -1 is win for opponent and 1 is win for player. this tree continues to grow to leafs where two players has stopped. each leaf is a final state of game where winner is decided and then we backtrack to parent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   with Alpha-Beta pruning we can prune unnecessary branches of search tree. for example in Min node where opponent is trying to minimize game result if in some branches the opponent's agent reaches to a result having -1 value it is unnecessary to check other branchs as this result is optimum. the same applies for Max nodes and branches that result in player win. of course this is a basic explanation of Alpha-Beta pruning. in minimax function alpha and beta values get passed from higher level nodes and pruning is applied as it is designed in real algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __a 'log' parameter was added to some functions in both classes to make log prints optional.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __a boolean field called 'Prune' was added to Blacksin class making Alpha-Beta pruning optional in order to compare performance of search with and without pruning.__"

    "in this game when players can see the unused cards and other players deck and they know the value of cards that ther draw from deck on every decision. so the game is played in an detrministic environment and thus agents can use MiniMax easily by building search tree and visiting all possible states from current state and doing the best action they can do. but in non-deterministic environments where the value of a pulled card from decks is unknown the basic MiniMax cant be used. there are other algorithms for such situatons but we cant also improve MiniMax to perform in non-deterministic games.\n",

    "The expectiminimax algorithm is a variation of the minimax algorithm, for use in artificial intelligence systems that play two-player zero-sum games, in which the outcome depends on a combination of the player's skill and __chance__ elements such as dice rolls. In addition to \"min\" and \"max\" nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has \"chance\" (\"move by nature\") nodes, which take the expected value of a random event occurring. In game theory terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an extensive-form game of perfect, but incomplete information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional minimax method, the levels of the tree alternate from max to min until the depth limit of the tree has been reached. In an expectiminimax tree, the \"chance\" nodes are interleaved with the max and min nodes. Instead of taking the max or min of the utility values of their children, chance nodes take a weighted average, with the weight being the probability that child is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this project if the agents cant see the deck cards clearly they can keep track of pulled out cards and also use a probabilty distribution for examining probabilty of drawing each remaining card so they can use this probabilites in expectminimax algorithm and perform good in this version of game."

    "MiniMax is somehow a blind search algorithm as it expands all possible nodes in each state and tries every possible move for reaching to optimum result. so order of taking actions in each states doesnt affect final result in minimax algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "but when we use Alpha-Beta pruning we want to prune branch as maximum as possible in order to reach better performance in case of time and space complexity. in such situations order of expanding nodes can help Alpha-Beta pruning. if we traverse promising branches first the pruning algorithm prune other branches more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example in our project where leaf nodes' result is only -1,0 or 1 if in higher branchs we traverse a branch with final '1' result for our agent first, the pruning heuristic after seeing a 'win' branch can prune other 3 branches and it leads to pruning almost 50% of nodes of search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this game with some observations on different strategies i find out that in each state starting with erasing cards from agents deck or opponent's deck is more promising than drawing card from game's deck and also drawing card is more promising than stopping. the intuition behind this strategy is that stopping too early can give your opponent chance to remove card from your dec and at the same time opponent can draw card so it results in increase of opponents score and decreasing your score. also drawing cards can be dangerous as number of your remaining erases decreases and we get closer to end of game, drawing cards has risk of surpasing the limited 41 score.\n"
