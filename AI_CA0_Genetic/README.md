# Goal Of Project

In this project, we apply the Genetic Algorithms to the problem of hospital job scheduling. There are N working days and each day is partitioned in three shifts: morning, evening and night shifts . There is constraints on each shift on minimum and maximum number of doctors that are available in the shift. Also a doctor cant do night shifts for 3 consecutive nights and also cant do morning or evening shift the day after he or she is doing night shift. There is a limit for a single doctor's number of shifts in N days. Since the Genetic Algorithm is used for efficiently searching a large problem space, it can find the solution to the scheduling problem in a reasonable time. The methodology and codes are all explained throughout this report and the effect of several related parameters and techniques are discussed.

# 1. Introducing the Genetic Algorithm Related Concepts in the Problem

## 1.1 Genes And Chromosomes

Chromosomes are defined by __N__ binary segments. Each segment represents the schedule of that day. Each day's segment containts three __D__ (number of doctors) bit binary string representing doctors status in morning, evening and nights shifts in that order. if __i__'th bit of a shift is __0__ means that __i__'th doctor is resting that shift and if its __1__ the __i__'th doctor is working in that shift

there is no exact definition oof genes in this model. as we do crossover based on days we can consider each days string as genes. also we do mutation on single bits so bits can be genes too.

<h4><center> Chromosome = (Gene of day 1 | Gene of day 2 | .... | Gene of day N) </center></h4>
<h4><center> Gene of day i = (status of morning shift | status of evening shift | status of night shift) </center></h4>
<h4><center> Status of shift j = (presence of doctor 1 | presence of doctor 2 | ....| presence of doctor D) </center></h4>

## 1.2 Crossover

In the Genetic Algorithm, Crossover is done to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. The regular method of crossover (simple K point or uniform crossover) can be used with this model as there is no dependency between chromosome's bits. We use simple K point crossover. 

## 1.3 Mutation

Also mutation with this model is straight forward. As there is no dependency between bits a single bit cant be mutated independently of other bits.
Mutating a bit means changing a single doctor's presence on a shift

The chance of occurring mutation in each chromosome at each generation is represented by Mutation Probability. This number can be a constant or can get reduced for a specific amount after each generation. Reducing Strategy is due to the fact that it is expected that as more generations are produced, the need for random decisions will decrease and searching the problem's whole space is going to reduce. In this problem we use simple constant probability for mutation

## 1.4 Fitness Function

Performance of a schedule is measured by two factors. First one is number of shifts that dont violate constraints on number of doctors working in that shift. or each shift that vioilates this constraints __ShiftsCost__ increases by one.

Second one is number of doctors that violate constraints on night shifts or maximum working capacity of a single doctor. Each doctor can violates multiple rules in a single scheduling (for example working more than 3 consecutive nights and also working more than limit in total). For each violation __DoctorsCost__ increases by one.

The total cost function is calculated by bellow formula:
<h4><center> Total Cost = DoctorsPenaltyWeight*DoctorsCost + ShiftsPenaltyWeight*ShiftsCost </center></h4>

In this problem __DoctorsPenaltyWeight__ and __ShiftsPenaltyWeight__ are equal but different weightings can be used when priorities and goals differ.

## 1.5 Choosing Chromosomes for Population Refinement

### 1.5.1 Selecting the Remaining Chromosomes

After evaluating the population in each generation using the fitness function, chromosomes with better performance must remain in the next generation while others must be replaced by a new generation. While selecting chromosomes with the highest fitness function values as the survived population seems to be a reasonable procedure, in action it is observed that giving small random chances of survival to other chromosomes with lower performance will sometimes improve the efficiency of the algorithm. In this project a certain percent of best chromosomes will be transfered too next generation directly(with out crossover and mating). From rest of chromosomes selecting The survived population is based on a random procedure in which each of the chromosomes will receive a probability for survival and the new population is selected based on the mentioned probabilities form the population. The more the survival probability of a chromosome be the more its chance for survival will be.

The survival probability for each of the chromosomes are computed using the below formula:

<h2>$$ùëÉ_ùëñ=\frac{ùëí^{-ùõºùëâ_ùëñ}}{\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}ùëí^{-ùõºùëâ_ùëõ}}$$</h2>
    
where __P_i__ is the survival probability,  __ùëâ_ùëñ__  is the fitness value of the __ùëñ__'th chromosome, __ùëÅ__ is the number of chromosomes and __ùõº__ is a non-negative small number. For  __ùõº__=0 , the probability of survival would be equal for all of the chromosomes in the population and as __ùõº__ grows, the probability of survival for chromosomes with higher fitness values (in this problem lower fitness values are equal to negative cost of a schedule so they are considered better) will decrease. Exponential terms are used for computing the probabilities in order to reinforce the difference between the chance of survival of chromosomes with higher and lower fitness function values.

### 1.5.2 Choosing Couples for Crossover Operation

The chromosome couples for the crossover operation are selected from the selected chromosomes to be remain. The process of choosing the parents is also in a random procedure. We choose random couples from chromosomes and perform crossoover on them with a constant probability

Other algorithms can be used for mating of chromosomes. a simple algortihm could use product of two chromosomes' fitness value as probabilty of mating those two. The bigger the product of the values of two chromosomes, the higher their chance of being selected for crossover.


<h2>$$ùëÑ_{ùëñ,ùëó} = \frac{ùëí^{ùõΩùëâ_ùëñùëâ_ùëó}}{ \Sigma_{n=1}^{N}{\Sigma_{m=n+1}^{N} ùëí^{ùõΩùëâ_ùëõùëâ_ùëö}}} , ùëñ>ùëó $$</h2>
 
where __Q_i_j__  is the probability, __V_i__  is the fitness value of the __i__ 'th chromosome, __V_j__  is the fitness value of the __j__'th chromosome, __N__ is the number of chromosomes from which we are selecting and __ùõΩ__  is an anon-negative small number. For  __ùõΩ__=0 , the probability of selection would be equal for each chromosome couples in the population and as __ùõΩ__ grows, the probability of being chosen for chromosomes with a lower product of fitness values will decrease. Like the formula mentioned in the previous section, exponential terms are used for computing the probabilities in order to reinforce the difference between the chance of crossover for more eligible couples.

# 2 Discussing the Results and Effect of Parameters

## 2.1 Mutation Vs. Crossover

Generally speaking, while Crossover accounts for pulling the population towards a local minimum/maximum, Mutation is intended to occasionally break one or more members of a population out of a local minimum/maximum space and potentially discover a better minimum/maximum space. In other words, __Crossover is a convergence operation and responsible for fast convergence__ while __Mutation is a divergence operation avoiding the population to become too similar to each other__.

Since the end goal is to bring the population to convergence, usually crossover happens more frequently. Mutation should happen less frequently to bring diversity into the population and typically only affects a few members of a population in any given generation.

This does not mean that Crossover is more important than Mutation or that Mutation must not be used at all. __Both of the mentioned operations are important for adequate convergence and must be applied at their place__.

__If the mutation operation is not applied in the algorithm__, the similarity between chromosomes would occur after few generations, meaning the algorithm has stuck into local minimum/maximum and would become incapable of finding the global optimal solution.

__If the crossover operation is not applied to the algorithm__, fast and adequate convergence is not possible at all and the process would become a simple exhaustive search.

## 2.2 The Effect of The Population Size

The population size plays a key role in the Genetic Algorithm's performance and it is important to be set properly. For small population size, the Genetic Algorithm can __converge early on a slope and it will not provide an adequate initial surface exploration__. But __this fact does not necessarily mean that a larger population size always ends with better results__. A large population __takes an excessive number of function evaluations__ to converge and __slow down the process of finding the optimal solution__.

## 2.3 Avoid Getting Stuck on Local Optimum

Like other evolutionary algorithms, the Genetic Algorithm can not always guarantee to reach the best answer and its performance reduced by falling in local minimum/maximums. While there is no certain method for avoiding such situations, the following approaches may be found useful:

   &emsp;- Multiple runs with different seeds of initial chromosomes are the easiest way to find the optimal solution            to a problem and can sometimes preserve the algorithm from getting stuck in local optimums (known as Random Restart Algorithm).


   &emsp;- Increasing the mutation probability for each generation while running the algorithm may remedy the problem.            As it was discussed earlier, the main purpose of using the Mutation technique is to avoid getting stuck in            local optimums and exploring more of the problem space. Hence, increasing the Mutation operations while              generating a new population, seems a logical way out of the problem.

&emsp;- Increasing the population which is kept at each generation of the algorithm may also help to escape from local optimums since larger population would explore more of the problem space which lowers the chance of falling in local minimums/maximums (but also deacreases the speed).

&emsp;- It is observed that giving a small probability of survival and attending crossover to chromosomes with lower fitness function values can sometimes preserve the Genetic algorithm from local optimums.


Some of these techniques mentioned above were used in the project to avoid local optimums and improve the performance and speed of the genetic algorithm and some others were unnecessary in this problem.
