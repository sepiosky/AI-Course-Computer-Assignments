    "In this project, we apply the Genetic Algorithms to the problem of hospital job scheduling. There are N working days and each day is partitioned in three shifts: morning, evening and night shifts . There is constraints on each shift on minimum and maximum number of doctors that are available in the shift. Also a doctor cant do night shifts for 3 consecutive nights and also cant do morning or evening shift the day after he or she is doing night shift. There is a limit for a single doctor's number of shifts in N days. Since the Genetic Algorithm is used for efficiently searching a large problem space, it can find the solution to the scheduling problem in a reasonable time. The methodology and codes are all explained throughout this report and the effect of several related parameters and techniques are discussed."

In this project a certain percent of best chromosomes will be transfered too next generation directly(with out crossover and mating). From rest of chromosomes selecting The survived population is based on a random procedure in which each of the chromosomes will receive a probability for survival and the new population is selected based on the mentioned probabilities form the population.

    "The population size plays a key role in the Genetic Algorithm's performance and it is important to be set properly. For small population size, the Genetic Algorithm can __converge early on a slope and it will not provide an adequate initial surface exploration__. But __this fact does not necessarily mean that a larger population size always ends with better results__. A large population __takes an excessive number of function evaluations__ to converge and __slow down the process of finding the optimal solution__."

    "Like other evolutionary algorithms, the Genetic Algorithm can not always guarantee to reach the best answer and its performance reduced by falling in local minimum/maximums. While there is no certain method for avoiding such situations, the following approaches may be found useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "   &emsp;- Multiple runs with different seeds of initial chromosomes are the easiest way to find the optimal solution            to a problem and can sometimes preserve the algorithm from getting stuck in local optimums (known as Random Restart Algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   &emsp;- Increasing the mutation probability for each generation while running the algorithm may remedy the problem.            As it was discussed earlier, the main purpose of using the Mutation technique is to avoid getting stuck in            local optimums and exploring more of the problem space. Hence, increasing the Mutation operations while              generating a new population, seems a logical way out of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;- Increasing the population which is kept at each generation of the algorithm may also help to escape from local optimums since larger population would explore more of the problem space which lowers the chance of falling in local minimums/maximums (but also deacreases the speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;- It is observed that giving a small probability of survival and attending crossover to chromosomes with lower fitness function values can sometimes preserve the Genetic algorithm from local optimums.\n",
